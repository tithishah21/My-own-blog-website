            I'm <b>Tithi Shah</b>, a passionate university student 
            with a keen interest in coding, technology, and 
            continuous learning. Currently pursuing my degree 
            in CSE CORE at <b>VIT,Vellore</b>.I spend most
            of my time diving into the fascinating world of 
            programming and software development.<br>
            My journey into coding began when I wrote my 
            first line of code in high school and was instantly
            hooked. Since then, I've been exploring various 
            programming languages and technologies. I'm 
            particularly fascinated by web development, data science,
            AI/ML,etc and I'm always on the lookout for new
            challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.

            In addition to my academic pursuits, I am 
            actively involved in various university events 
            and organizations.I have participated in many events like 
            hackathons,E-Cell events,etc.
             My dedication to excellence has been
            recognized through several awards.My team secured 7th position
            out of 150 teams in an event,
            Futurepreneurs 9.0 held by E-Cell.
            My team also got 17th position in a hackathon 
            organised by IEEE-CS during graVITas'23. Balancing
            my studies with these extracurricular activities
            has honed my leadership, teamwork, and time 
            management skills, all of which I believe are 
            crucial for success in both academic and 
            professional spheres.<br>
            During my school life,I received a trophy for academically standing first among all sections of class 8th[98%].
